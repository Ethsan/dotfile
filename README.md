# My configuration for LazyVim

Base configuration for LazyVim with less plugins and more native features.

Most of UI plugins are disabled, they were more noisy than useful. Some other
features are disabled like ghost text, highlight under cursor which I find
very distracting.

Plugins added:

- Copilot
- CopilotChat
- Jukit (A python plugin to use python script as notebook)
- Obsidian (A plugin to edit markdown obsidian files)
- Undotree (A plugin to show all edits of a file)
- Presence (Rich presence discord)
